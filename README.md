# intro-to-design-patterns

I will be making notes of different design patterns in this repo. I am not an expert, I took these notes while learning myself.

## How to study from this repo
- Each design patterns has a folder of it's own, related explanation can be found in LECTURE.md of each sub folder in this repo.



## What are design patterns?
- Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
- There are different type of design patterns
    - `Creational design patterns` => These design patterns are all about class instantiation, Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    - `Structural design patterns` => These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
    - `Behavioral design patterns` => These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects
